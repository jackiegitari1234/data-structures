BIG O
compare codes
1st rule of simplification - drop constants
2nd rule of simplification - drop non dominants

space complexity
memory

time complexity
- not time, no of operations per seconds
omega - Ω - best case
Theta - θ - average case
Omicron, big O - 0 - worst case


O(1)
constant time
most efficient

Olog(n)
find an item in a sorted array
next best thing to O(1)
divide and conquer

O(n)
straight line, proportional
print items in a list, two loops of similar input
two loops of different input - O(a+b)

O(n^2) squared - n*n, less efficient
for loop inside another with one input
two loops of different input - O(a*b)


Arraylist
add item at end-  O(1)
remove item at end -  O(1)
add item at beginning,or other positions-  O(n)
remove item at beginning,or other position -  O(n)
look for item by value - O(n)
look for item by index - O(1)

pointers
hashmap - retain pointers

HashMap
does not allow duplicate keys, but duplicate values can be added to it.
